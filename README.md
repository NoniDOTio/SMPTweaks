### What is SMPTweaks?
___

Vanilla Minecraft is made for single players and it shows. When more than a handful people hop on a server, various problems arise, such as shortage of non-renewable items and (almost) unusable gameplay mechanics like sleeping.
This plugin provides various tweaks that enhance multiplayer experience and adds level system, login rewards and other nice-to-haves.

SMPTweaks is fully modular, largely async and built in a lightweight way with high player counts in mind.
